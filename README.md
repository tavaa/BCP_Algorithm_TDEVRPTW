# TD-EVRPTW — Branch-Cut-and-Price (BCP)

A research-grade implementation of a Branch–Cut–and–Price algorithm for the **Time-Dependent Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (TD-EVRPTW)**. The solver supports **time-dependent travel speeds**, **piecewise-linear (PWL) charging**, and **time-dependent station waiting**; it uses **Gurobi** as LP/MIP backend.

This project contains the material for the final exam project of the *Mathematical Optimisation* course for the academic year 2024-25. This course is offered by UniTS (Università degli Studi di Trieste), Trieste, Italy.

## Introduction
This repository implements a BCP framework consistent with the referenced paper for TD-EVRPTW.

Key ingredients:
- **Restricted Master Problem (RMP)** with set-partitioning over routes.
- **Exact and heuristic pricing** via forward labeling with time/battery resources.
- **Valid inequalities** (Subset-Row Cuts, k=2).
- **Branching** on consecutive customers (CSB) with a fallback to physical arc branching (ABR).
- **Physics-consistent** time-dependent travel, PWL charging to full at stations, and station waiting patterns.

## Usage

### 1) Installation

Activate a virtual environment and install the requirements. Ensure to have the Gurobi licence, to fully exploit the solver capabilities.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2) Data

Place JSON instances under `data/TDEVRPTW/` (example: `r209C15_td.json`). Each instance defines:

**nodes** (customers, stations, depot with coordinates, TW, service),

**parameters** (planning horizon T, capacities, charging/consumption params),

**time_dependent_definitions** (speed profiles, PWL charging, waiting),

**time_dependent_assignments** (arc→speed profile, station→charging mode).

### 3) Run a single instance (Python)

```python
from src.bcp_solver import BCPSolver
res = BCPSolver("data/TDEVRPTW/r209C15_td.json", num_processes=1).solve()
print(res["best_cost"], res["nodes_explored"])
```

### 4) External checks and plotting (Notebook)

```python
from src.utils import load_instance
from utils.test_utilities import simple_external_feasibility_check, plot_instance_and_routes

inst_path = "data/TDEVRPTW/r209C15_td.json"
ext = simple_external_feasibility_check(load_instance(inst_path), res["best_solution"] or [])
print("External feasible:", ext["feasible"])
plot_instance_and_routes(load_instance(inst_path), res["best_solution"], res["best_cost"])
```


## Features & Implementation

- **Time-Dependent Travel Speeds**  
  Each arc is assigned a congestion profile (e.g., *high/normal/low*). Travel time and energy are computed by advancing across time intervals with profile-based multipliers.

- **Non-Linear Charging (PWL)**  
  Each station has a charging **mode** (e.g., *slow/medium/fast*) mapped to a **piecewise-linear** function. On arrival at a station, the vehicle recharges **to full** using the PWL inverse (consistent with the paper).

- **Labeling & Dominance**  
  Forward labeling enforces TW, horizon, battery feasibility, Rule 1 via **MBR** bounds, and includes dominance (scalar + partial) to prune labels safely.

- **Pricing**  
  Heuristics (`k-shrink`, relaxed rules) run in parallel; if none yields negative reduced-cost routes, an **exact** pricing run is attempted under a timeout.

- **Cuts (SRC k=2)**  
  Heuristic separation over small subsets of customers; most violated cuts added to the RMP, avoiding duplicates via cache.

- **Branching**  
  Primary: **Customer-Successor Branching** (Ryan–Foster on consecutive customers).  
  Fallback: **Arc Branching** on immediate $(i \to j)$.

- **Parallelism**  
  Multiprocessing for pricing; deep copies isolate worker state.


## Results

### Scalability Mini-Study (C10, C15, C20)

Replicated the baseline test on:
- **C15**: original instance,
- **C10**: -5 customers (removed from C15),
- **C25**: +10 customers (augmented from C15).

For each, has been recorded:
- `instance_name | cost | n.routes_found | feasible | n.nodes_explored`

| instance_name | cost               | n.routes_found | feasible | n.nodes_explored |
|:--------------|-------------------:|---------------:|:--------:|-----------------:|
| r209C15_TD    | 253.90599156857513 | 3              | True     | 1                |
| r209C15_TD    | 379.8127020718137  | 3              | True     | 5                |
| r209C20_TD    | 585.9096010382843  | 5              | True     | 9                |


Artifacts:
- Plots in `results/scalability/`
- CSV summary: `results/scalability/scalability_results.csv`

> The augmentation preserves all TD components and expands `arc_speed_profiles` consistently, defaulting to `"normal"` for arcs involving newly added customers.
