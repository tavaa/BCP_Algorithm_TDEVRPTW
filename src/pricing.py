"""Pricing: exact labeling-based solver + simple heuristics (warm start).

- Exact pricing uses forward labeling with dominance and LB pruning.
- Heuristics provide quick negative columns (single-customer 0-c-0, small chains).

This file is compatible with:
- bcp_solver.BCPSolver (calls via pricing_worker.solve_pricing_wrapper)
- model.RMP_Model (expects route dicts with 'path', 'cost', 'customers_visited')
- labeling.Label / labeling.extend_label
- dominance.check_dominance
- utils.get_travel_time_and_consumption

    Exact pricing via forward labeling with dominance and bounding.

    Args:
        instance: Problem data (nodes, distances, TD profiles, parameters).
        duals: Dual values from the current RMP (used inside extend_label to update reduced costs).
        branching_constraints: Branch-and-bound constraints; supports {'forbidden_arcs'} as a set of (i, j).
        max_neg_routes: Maximum number of negative reduced-cost routes to return.
        max_labels: Safety cap on the total number of generated/processed labels.
        graph_mask: Optional mask of allowed arcs (currently unused).

            - 'cost': route reduced cost c_r (negative if improving),
            - 'customers_visited': set of customer IDs served by the route.

    Notes:
        - Labels are expanded from the depot using a priority heap ordered by
          (reduced_cost, time, -battery, num_visited_customers, node_id).
        - Dominance is enforced per bucket keyed by (node, last_customer_id).
        - Pruning: elementarity on customers, avoid stationâ†’station chains,
          respect forbidden_arcs, and apply a simple LB using the per-node
          lower bound to return to the depot.
        - A route is finalized only when a label at the depot has visited at least one customer.
